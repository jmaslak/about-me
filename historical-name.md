# My Past Writings

In the past, I've written code and prose under other names. I generally prefer to be cited as "Joelle Maslak" or "Joelle Tori Maslak", even when the original writing was under another name. In most of the circumstances where my writing would be used, this should pose little trouble.  I wrote it, and you're naming the author.

My pronouns are she/her/hers.  This applies to present and past writings.

Should you be bound by strict regulations that prohibit this, simply use my initial for my first name. I.E. "J. Maslak".  I don't prefer this form, but it is a better option than to use my old names.

# Other Situations

Should other situations arise where the above guidance is unworkable, I'm glad to work with you towards a solution. Please contact me at my jmaslak@antelope.net address.

# Taking Matters into Your Own Hands

if you have material that references me, simply changing it to reference my new name is something that will bring me great joy. You do not need my explicit permission to do this - I'm granting that permission to you with this note!

# Other People

Other people who have changed their name may have different desires.  You can often figure this out by reading thier current writings/code: how do they refer to the past?
